          <p>Flexible Product Quantity Steps: Users should be able to add products to their cart in specified quantity steps. For instance, they should have the option to add products in increments ranging from 1 to 12 or 6 to 12, depending on the product. Individual Minimum Order Quantities: Each product should have its own minimum order quantity. If a user attempts to add a quantity below this minimum, they should receive an immediate alert before they checkout indicating that the minimum cart quantity for that product has not been met. Individual Maximum Order Quantities: Similarly, each product should have a set maximum order quantity, distinct from a global setting. This will ensure users can't exceed the maximum quantity specified for any individual product.</p>

          <p>Hello, You had added below extra points in the requirement detail, which we had not discussed in our quotation. If you want this feature to develop as well then it will cost extra. These settings, which encompass flexible product quantity steps, minimum, and maximum quantity options, should also be made accessible for specific categories. This approach avoids the need to configure these settings individually for over 100 products, streamlining the process. Thanks &amp; Regards, Ecarter Support</p>

            We have already completed 80% of the requirements that we discussed and agreed to work.
            
            Regarding your new point that you put in requirement details without discussing or informing any few words. If you wanted this feature you would had to discuss with us and inform us, then we can say what and with what cost we can develop.
            
            We will deliver you the discussed and agreed requirements by Sunday morning.
            
            If you want to developed that requires features, we can share quote for that as well.

            It is now well beyond Sunday morning, and we haven't witnessed any signs of progress or received the agreed-upon delivery as promised. We were assured a completed and delivered product by Sunday morning, and unfortunately, this commitment has not been met. If this issue is not addressed promptly and resolved to our satisfaction, we will be compelled to escalate it to our payment processor to request a full refund.

            We tried to deliver it early on Sunday, but during testing we found some points that need correction and now it's completed.
            We are delivering it on Monday as agreed.
            Please once verify the demo we have created for your customization over here:

            It's crucial that we honor these updated deadlines. Failing to do so undermines our credibility, and I have upheld my end of the agreement. I urge you to fulfill your commitments as well, without resorting to placing blame on us. Additionally, it's important to note that no documented attempts were made to contact us or inform us of any issues that may have arisen Sunday morning.</p>

That's why we were waiting for confirmation of your new point. Our final deadline was monday which is today. If we're not able to deliver today, then it's dishonour of commitment.

            So, please do check it at our demo site that we shared, and confirm. If all good we can share you addon zip file.
            
            Also please let us know if we have to made customization of your new points, so we can share quotation for that requirement as well.

          <p>Is there a possibility, without incurring an additional fee, to customize this addon to align perfectly with our current requirements? At present, the addon falls short of meeting our shopping experience needs completely. It appears that certain functionalities we've requested have not been fully implemented. The key points here are as follows:

            Users should be able to add products to their cart in specified quantity steps. For instance, they should have the option to add products in increments ranging from 1 to 12 or 6 to 12, depending on the product
            
            If a user attempts to add a quantity below this minimum, they should receive an immediate alert before they checkout indicating that the minimum cart quantity for that product has not been met.
            
            In essence, regardless of the minimum order quantity, users should be able to add quantities less than the minimum until they reach the required minimum order quantity. This is the essence of the two statements we've made.</p>

            This is the cs-cart marketplace platform where we are discussing requirements and finalizing quotations. If there is any new point you should discuss here.

          <p>Dear Ecarter Technologies Pvt Ltd,

            I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to remind you that as of today, February 7, 2024, we have not received the requested add-on, which was due by your specified deadline of February 5, 2024. Despite us willing to accept the addon as is even if it did not meet our specifications, we have yet to receive the zip file as promised. Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.
            
            Best regards,</p>

          <p>Dear Ecarter Technologies Pvt Ltd,

            I hope this message finds you well. We recently attempted to access the demo at this link: <a href="https://develop.ecarter.co/fstore/admin.php">https://develop.ecarter.co/fstore/admin.php</a> as per your instructions but were unable to locate it. The following screenshot illustrates the issue we encountered: <a href="https://prnt.sc/AgZ-eFlDbBzc">https://prnt.sc/AgZ-eFlDbBzc</a>. As of today, February 8, 2024, this places us beyond 2 deadlines now and further pased a final deadline of February 5, 2024 Both set by Ecarter Technologies Pvt Ltd. I trust this oversight was unintentional, and at this time we will continue to attempt to resolve this matter of non delivery with paypal, as you have yet to fulfil our request for the payment he have already sent to you.
            
            Best regards,</p>
